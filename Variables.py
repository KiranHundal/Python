# 1:
persons_name = "Gurpreet"
persons_name = "Amrit"
# 2:
persons_name = "Kiran"



# 1:
age = 19
age = 21
age = 25

# "Amrit" = string
# 21 = ini(integers)

# 3:
# print(persons_name, age)

# 4:
# if age is greater than 18
# if age > 18:
# print: you are older than 18.
    # print("You are older than 18.")
# else:
